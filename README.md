# blit-crusher

Bit-crush images, potentially after colorspace conversion.

# Meaning…

Have you ever wondered what truecolor RGB332 would look like?  Maybe an HSV
system with 30 hues, 8 saturations, and 16 values?

This is 50% “a toolkit that would let you do those things” by doing the
conversion, then inverting it so you can see the results in a perfectly
ordinary PNG output file.

# And 50% what else?

Deep research for an epic blog post about functional programming.  Thus, the
F#.

# “Blit”? That’s not the right word.

You should write about it on your [blag](https://xkcd.com/148/).

# Roadmap

I found out GitHub has a mini-Trello they call
[Projects](https://github.com/sapphirecat/blit-crusher/projects),
so I put everything there.
It seems a lot lighter weight than making an issue for everything.
